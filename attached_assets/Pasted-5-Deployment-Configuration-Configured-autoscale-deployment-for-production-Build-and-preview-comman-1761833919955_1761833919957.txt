ðŸš€ Next Steps to Continue
Immediate Actions Needed:

Set up your Supabase database:

Go to your Supabase project
Open the SQL Editor
Copy and paste the entire supabase/schema.sql file
Run it to create all tables and policies
Verify environment variables (already set in your Replit Secrets):

VITE_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
Test the authentication flow:

The app now requires login - try creating an account
Verify you can sign in and out
To Continue Development:

The foundation is solid! The next big milestone is Phase 2: Migrating all localStorage data to Supabase. This involves:

Creating Supabase hooks to replace localStorage calls
Updating components to use React Query hooks
Testing data persistence in the database
